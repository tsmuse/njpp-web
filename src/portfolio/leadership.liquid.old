    <h1>Leadership</h1>
    <p>
      Hi there! Thanks for taking the time to look at my stuff. I know this is one
      of a stack of portfolios you're looking at inbetween meetings or while you
      drink your coffee, before you get back into all the other non-hiring stuff
      on your plate. So let's get right to it: The following are three case summaries
      of teams I've lead at three very different companies working on three very different
      products.
    <p>
      In addition to these leadership case studies you may also want to check 
      out my writing <a href="#">about design</a> and <a href="#">code as a 
      design tool.</a> Maybe you're interested in <a href="#">individual design work?</a>  
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for taking the time to stop by. I hope I've piqued your interest 
      and you're dying to have a more in-depth conversation soon.
    </p>
